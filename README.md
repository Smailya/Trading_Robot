# Trading_Robot
I developed a Trading_Robot which is based on Python bot for automated crypto trading on the VALR exchange ðŸš€. It uses technical indicators and a robust risk management strategy to execute trades based on set conditions. Includes a Flask web dashboard for real-time monitoring of bot activity and performance ðŸ“Š.

Features
Automated Trading: Executes buy and sell orders based on technical analysis indicators such as Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
Risk Management: Implements strict risk management rules, including position sizing and dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels.
Backtesting: Allows for historical backtesting of trading strategies to evaluate performance before live trading.
Real-time Monitoring: Flask web application to display real-time trading activity, historical actions, and performance metrics.
Logging: Comprehensive logging of all trading actions and errors to facilitate debugging and performance evaluation.
